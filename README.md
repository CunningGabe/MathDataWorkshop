# Math Data Workshop

[Nicolas' notes](https://hackmd.io/4b8zBeKLS6i9w84G0ChanA?view)

Sheets and towels should be there. Bring toiletries!

## Bring to the workshop / Preparations

- Transfer data to server pre-workshop (the internet access will not support transfering large amounts of data)
- Fresh food for Saturday and Sunday (Samuel and Katja)
- A few power strips
- Scrap paper

## Things to do or figure out

### Datasets

#### List of target datasets
- Abstract polytopes and maniplexes (Gabe, Katja)
- Symmetric graphs (Katja, Gabe)
- Lattices (Jukka)
- Small Groups Library export (Michael T., Katja)

#### Things to do with each

1. Prioritize (make list in order of importance) properties of datasets for the other dataset tasks.
2. Write schema theories
3. Formalize relevant math
4. Import into

Initial assignments:
- 1: Gabe, Jukka, Katja
- 2 and 3: Gabe, Jukka, Katja, Michael T. with Dennis
- 4: Gabe, Jukka, Katja, Michael T. with Tom

#### Other

- Connect the small groups with [Group Names](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/index.html) and the [Group Explorer](https://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/GroupExplorer.html).
- How to deal with the above in general way, (so that the below can also be handled) so that we can add such things without too much work - Florian?
- How to deal with [p-adic](https://gitlab.com/mathzeta2/zetalib/blob/master/zetalib/p-adic-examples.json)

### Interface

- Choosing collections (defaults?), choosing columns displayed by default
- Support the filter box with autocomplete-type search (in case there are many)
- Usability: intro tour of the interface (see [intro.js](https://introjs.com/)), pop-up definitions
- Out there: new graphic image and/or colour scheme to integrate with MathHub?

#### Computer algebra system integration

- How to do it? - MitM
- Sage explorer connection?
