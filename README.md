# Math Data Workshop

## Bring to the workshop

- A few power strips

## Things to do or figure out

### Datasets

#### List of target datasets
- Abstract polytopes and maniplexes
- Symmetric graphs
- Lattices
- Small Groups Library export

#### Things to do with each

- Write schema theories
- Formalize relevant math
- Import into

#### Other

- Connect the small groups with [Group Names](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/index.html) and the [Group Explorer](https://nathancarter.github.io/group-explorer/GroupExplorer.html).
- How to deal with [](https://gitlab.com/mathzeta2/zetalib/blob/master/zetalib/p-adic-examples.json)

### Interface

- Choosing collections (defaults?), columns displayed by default

#### Computer algebra system integration

- How to do it?
- Sage explorer connection?
